# TodoApp
This is a TodoApp i'm making for my #100DaysOfCode challenge with React Native.
As I was just starting with the library I was trying to use as little external libraries as possible, the ones I used were: 
- [Async Storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/usage/) 
- [LinearGradient from Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/linear-gradient/)
